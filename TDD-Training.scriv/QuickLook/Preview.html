<p class="binderItem"><strong>Rhythm of TDD</strong><br/>My goal is for you to see the rhythm of test-driven development:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Quickly add a test<br/>
2.  Run all tests and see the new one fail<br/>
3.  Make a little change<br/>
4.  Run all tests and see them all succeed<br/>
5.  Refactor to remove duplication<br/>
<br/>
The surprises are likely to be:<br/>
<br/>
1.  How each test can cover a small increment of functionality<br/>
2.  How small and ugly the changes can be to make the new tests run<br/>
3.  How often the tests are run<br/>
4.  How many teensy tiny steps make up the refactorings<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Money Example</strong><br/>Let’s start with the object multi-currency money. We have a report like this:<br/>
<br/>
￼<br/>
To make a multi-currency report, we need to add currencies:<br/>
<br/>
￼<br/>
We also need to specify exchange rates:<br/>

What behavior do we need to produce the revised report?<br/>
What is the set of tests which, when passed, will demonstrate the presence of code we are confident will compute the report correctly?<br/>

We need to be able to add amounts in two different currencies and convert the result given a set of exchange...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>TDD Cyle</strong><br/>TDD Cycle<br/>
<br/>
The general TDD cycle is :<br/>
<br/>
1. Write a test. <br/>
<br/>
Think about how you would like the operation in your mind to appear in your code. You are writing a story. Invent the interface you wish you had. Include all the elements in the story that you imagine will be necessary to calculate the right answers.<br/>
<br/>
2. Make it run. <br/>

</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Equality</strong><br/>If I have an integer and I add 1 to it, I don’t expect the original integer to change. I expect to to use the new value. Objects usually don’t behave that way. We can use objects as values, as we are using our Dollar now. The pattern for this is Value Object. One of the constraints of Value Objects is that the value of the instance variables of the object never change once they have been set in the constructor.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage of using Value Objects is that there is no aliasing problems. Say I ha...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Private</strong><br/>Make “amount” private<br/>
<br/>
Now that we have defined equality, we can use it to make our tests more expressive. Conceptually the operation times should return a Dollar whose value is the value of the receiver times the multiplier. Our test doesn’t exactly say that:<br/>
<br/>
Test_multiplication<br/>
Five = Dollar.new(5)<br/>
Product = five.times(2)<br/>
Assert(10, product.amount)<br/>
Product = five.times(3)<br/>
Assert(15, product.amount)<br/>
<br/>
We can rewrite the first assertion to compare Dollars to Dollars<br/>
<br/>
Test_multiplication<br/>
Five = D...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Franc</strong><br/>$5 + 10 CHF = $10 if rate is 2:1<br/>
5 CHF *2 = 10 CHF<br/>
<br/>
How are we going to approach the first test on that list? That’s the test that ’s most interesting. It still seems to be a big leap. I’m not sure I can write a test that I can implement in one little step. A pre-requisite seems to be having an object like Dollar, but to represent Francs. If we can get Francs working like Dollars work now, we’ll be closer to being able to write and run the mixed addition test.<br/>
<br/>
We can copy and edit the Dollar te...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Common Equals</strong><br/>We got a new test case working. However, we sinned mightily in copy/paste of code so we could do it quickly. Now it is time to clean up.<br/>
<br/>
One possibility is to make one of our classes extend the other. I tried it, and it hardly saves any code at all. Instead, we are going to find a common superclass for the two classes. What if we had a Money class to capture the common equals code? We can start small:<br/>
Class Money<br/>
<br/>
All the tests still run (not that we could possibly have broken anything, but tha...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Compare Francs to Dollars</strong><br/>Compare Francs to Dollars<br/>
<br/>
The thought struck us at the end of the last chapter - what happens when we compare Francs and Dollars? We dutifully turned our dreadful thought into an item on our to-do list. Let’s see what happens:<br/>
<br/>
Test_equality<br/>
AssertTrue(Dollar.new(5).equals(Dollar.new(5))<br/>
AssertFalse(Dollar.new(5).equals(Dollar.new(6))<br/>
AssertTrue(Franc.new(5).equals(Franc.new(5))<br/>
AssertFalse(Franc.new(5).equals(Franc.new(6))<br/>
AssertFalse(Franc.new(5).equals(Dollar.new(5))<br/>
<br/>
It fails. Dollars are F...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Making Objects</strong><br/>The two implementations of times are remarkably similar:<br/>
<br/>
Def times(multiplier)<br/>
Return Franc.new(amount * multiplier)<br/>
End<br/>
<br/>
Def times(multiplier)<br/>
Return Dollar.new(amount * multiplier)<br/>
End<br/>
<br/>
The two subclasses of Money aren’t doing enough work to justify their existence, so we can eliminate them. We will not do it with on big step because we want an effective demonstration of TDD.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, we would be one step closer to eliminating the subclasses if there were fewer references to the subclasses direct...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Eliminating Subclasses</strong><br/>What is there on our list that might help us eliminate the useless subclasses? What about currency? What would happen if we introduced the notion of currency?<br/>
<br/>
How do we want to implement currencies at the moment? Oops. How do we want to test for currencies at the moment?<br/>
<br/>
We may want to have complicated objects representing currencies, with flyweight factories to ensure we create no more objects than we really need. However, for the moment Strings will do:<br/>
<br/>
public void  testCurrency() {<br/>
assertE...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Refactoring times method</strong><br/> When we are done with this chapter we will have a single class to represent Money. The two implementations of times() are close, but not identical.<br/>
<br/>
Franc<br/>
Money times(int multiplier) {<br/>
return Money.franc(amount * multiplier);<br/>
}<br/>
Dollar<br/>
Money times(int multiplier) {<br/>
return Money.dollar(amount * multiplier);<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
 There’s not an obvious way to make them identical. Sometimes you have to go backwards to go forwards, a little like a Rubik’s Cube. What happens if we inline the factory methods? <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Deleting Subclasses</strong><br/> The two subclasses, Dollar and Franc, have only their constructors. Only a constructor<br/>
is not enough reason to have a subclass, so we want to delete the subclasses.<br/>
We can replace references to the subclasses by references to the superclass without<br/>
changing the meaning of the code. First Franc:<br/>
Franc<br/>
static Money franc(int amount) {<br/>
return new Money(amount, "CHF");<br/>
}<br/>
 Then Dollar:<br/>
Dollar<br/>
static Money dollar(int amount) {<br/>
return new Money(amount, "USD");<br/>
}<br/>
 Now there are no references to Dollar,...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Addition</strong><br/> I’m not sure how to write the story of the whole addition, so we’ll start with a simpler<br/>
example—$5 + $5 = $10.<br/>
public void testSimpleAddition() {<br/>
Money sum= Money.dollar(5).plus(Money.dollar(5));<br/>
assertEquals(Money.dollar(10), sum);<br/>
}<br/>
 We could fake the implementation by just returning “Money.dollar(10)”, but the<br/>
implementation seems obvious. We’ll try:<br/>
Money<br/>
Money plus(Money addend) {<br/>
return new Money(amount + addend.amount, currency);<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
 Where the design isn’t obvious I will still fake the ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Removing Duplication</strong><br/> We can’t mark our test for $5 + $5 done until we’ve removed all the duplication.<br/>
We don’t have code duplication, but we do have data duplication. The $10 in the<br/>
fake implementation:<br/>
<br/>
Bank<br/>
Money reduce(Expression source, String to) {<br/>
return Money.dollar(10);<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
 is really the same as the “$5 + $5” in the test:<br/>
public void testSimpleAddition() {<br/>
Money five= Money.dollar(5);<br/>
Expression sum= five.plus(five);<br/>
Bank bank= new Bank();<br/>
Money reduced= bank.reduce(sum, "USD");<br/>
assertEquals(Money.dollar(10...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Change</strong><br/> Reduce Money with conversion<br/>
<br/>
we are thinking about a much simpler form of<br/>
change—we have 2 francs and we want a dollar. That sounds like a test case<br/>
already:<br/>
<br/>
public void testReduceMoneyDifferentCurrency() {<br/>
Bank bank= new Bank();<br/>
bank.addRate("CHF", "USD", 2);<br/>
Money result= bank.reduce(Money.franc(2), "USD");<br/>
assertEquals(Money.dollar(1), result);<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
 When I go from francs to dollars, I divide by two (we’re still studiously ignoring all<br/>
those nasty numerical problems.) We can make the bar gre...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Mixed Currencies</strong><br/> Now we are finally ready to add the test that started it all, $5 + 10 CHF:<br/>
<br/>
public void testMixedAddition() {<br/>
Expression fiveBucks= Money.dollar(5);<br/>
Expression tenFrancs= Money.franc(10);<br/>
Bank bank= new Bank();<br/>
bank.addRate("CHF", "USD", 2);<br/>
Money result= bank.reduce(fiveBucks.plus(tenFrancs), "USD");<br/>
assertEquals(Money.dollar(10), result);<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
 This is what we’d like to write. Unfortunately, there are a host of compile errors.<br/>
When we were generalizing from Money to Expression, we left a lot of...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Abstraction</strong><br/> We need to implement Sum.plus() to finish Expression.plus, and then we need<br/>
Expression.times(), and then we’re finished with the whole example. Here’s the test<br/>
for Sum.plus():<br/>
<br/>
public void testSumPlusMoney() {<br/>
Expression fiveBucks= Money.dollar(5);<br/>
Expression tenFrancs= Money.franc(10);<br/>
Bank bank= new Bank();<br/>
bank.addRate("CHF", "USD", 2);<br/>
Expression sum= new Sum(fiveBucks, tenFrancs).plus(fiveBucks);<br/>
Money result= bank.reduce(sum, "USD");<br/>
assertEquals(Money.dollar(15), result);<br/>
}<br/>

 We could ha...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Set the Table</strong><br/> When you begin writing tests, you will discover a common pattern (Bill Wake<br/>
coined the phrase 3A for this):<br/>
<br/>
1.  Arrange—create some objects<br/>
2.  Act—stimulate them<br/>
3.  Assert—check the results<br/>
<br/>
The arrange step is often the same test-to-test, while the stimulation and checking<br/>
steps are unique. I have a 7 and 9. If I add them, I expect 16. If I subtract them, I<br/>
expect –2, if I multiply them, I expect 63. The stimulation and expected results are<br/>
unique, the 7 and the 9 don’t change.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Cleaning Up After</strong><br/> Tests will sometimes need to allocate external resources in setUp(). If we want the<br/>
tests to remain independent, a test that allocates external resources should release<br/>
them before it is done, perhaps in a tearDown() method.<br/>
<br/>
The simple minded way to write the test for deallocation is to introduce yet another<br/>
flag. All those flags are starting to bug me, and they are missing an important aspect<br/>
of the methods—setUp() is called before the test method is run, and tearDown() is<br/>
called afterwards. ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Counting</strong><br/>I was going to implement making sure tear_down is called regardless of exceptions during the test method. However, we have to catch exception to make the test work. If we make a mistake implementing this, we won’t be able to see the mistake because the exceptions won’t be reported. In general, the order of implementing the tests is important. When I pick the next test to implement, I find a test that will teach me something but which I have confidence I can make it work. If I get that test worki...</p>

Which test should you pick next from the list? Pick a test that will teach you something and that you are confident you can implement.<br/>

How do you get a test case running that turns out to be too big? Write a smaller test case that represents the broken part of the bigger test case. Get the smaller test case running. Reintroduce the larger test case.<br/>
<br/>
The red/green/refactor rhythm is so important for continuous success that when you are at risk of losing it, it is work extra effort to maintain it. This happens when the test accidentally requires several changes to make it work. Minimize the time in red bar.<br/>

These patterns are how to make the code pass (even if the result isn’t something you want to live with for even an hour)<br/>

The test should not be dependent on the implementation. It should use only public protocol. Wishing for white box testing is not a testing problem, it is a design problem.

How do you unify two similar looking pieces of code? Gradually bring them closer. Unify them only when they are absolutely identical.<br/>

There are really two questions lurking here:<br/>

The tendency of TDDers over time has been smaller steps. <br/>

What don’t you have to test?<br/>

Write tests until fear is transformed into boredom. You should test: conditionals, loops, operations, polymorphism. But only those that you write. Unless you have a reason to distrust it, don’t test code from others. <br/>

A very effective technique for identifying the root cause is the “Five Why’s”. First, we ask why something is occurring.

Some kinds of tests are harder to write than others.

Every test needs some kind of test fixture. A key part of understanding a test is understanding the test fixture and recognizing how it influences the expected outcome of the test. Tests are much easier to understand if the fixture is small and simple.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>xUnit Basic Patterns</strong><br/>Test Method<br/>
<br/>
We organize the test logic following one of the standard test method templates to make the type of test easily recognizable. In a simple success test, we have a purely linear flow of control from fixture setup through exercising the SUT to result verification. In an expected exception test, language based structures direct us to error-handling code. If we reach that code, we pass the test; if we don’t, we fail it.<br/>

State Based Testing<br/>
<br/>
How do we make tests self-checking when there is state to be verified?<br/>
We inspect the state of the SUT after it has been exercised and compare it to the expected state.<br/>
Fig goes here.<br/>
<br/>
We exercise the SUT by invoking the methods of interest. Then, as a separate step, we interact with the SUT to retrieve its post-exercise state and compare it with the expected end state by calling assertion methods.<br/>

How can we verify logic independently when code it depends on is unusable? How can we avoid slow tests? We replace a component on which the SUT depends with a test specific equivalent.<br/>

Sometimes it is hard to test the SUT because it depends on other components that cannot be used in the test environment.

A test may interact with the SUT directly via its public API or indirectly via its back door. The stimuli injected by the test into the SUT via its public API are direct inputs of the SUT. Direct inputs may consist of method calls to another component or messages sent on a message channel and the arguments or contents.<br/>

When the behavior of the SUT is affected by the values returned by another component whose services it uses, we call those values indirect inputs of...</p>

❂ It should be automated and repeatable.<br/>

❂ Anyone should be able to run it.<br/>

A walking skeleton is an implementation of the thinnest possible slice of real functionality that we can automatically build, deploy and test end-to-end. It should include just enough of the automation, the major components, and communication mechanisms to allow us to start working on the first feature. We keep the skeleton’s application functionality so simple that it’s obvious and uninteresting, leaving us free to concentrate on the infrastructure. For example, ...</p>

1. Starting with a test means that we have to describe what we want to achieve before we consider how. This focus helps us maintain the right level of abstraction for the target object. It also helps us with information hiding as we have to decide what needs to be visible from outside the object.<br/>

This failure defines the target for our next coding episode. It tells us, at a high level, what we’re aiming for - we just have to fill in implementation until it passes.<br/>

Our approach to TDD is to start with the outside event that triggers the behavior we want to implement and work our way into the code an object at a time, until we reach a visible effect (such as a sent message or log entry) indicating that we’ve achieved our goal.
